\section{Conclusion}

I have presented a method of solving a problem of automation of the testbed for research in the area of network security and security analytic regarding the problem of the lack of data. My proposal of the method is based on simulation of user behavior. To prove the concept of the method I provided the implementation of the idea and I successfully have used the simulation tool to generate necessary data for research. As result, I presented example of dataset produced by the simulator.
