\section{Conclusion}

I have presented a method of solving a problem of testbed automation for research in the area of network security and security analytics regarding the problem of the lack of data. My proposal is based on the simulation of user behavior. To prove the concept of the method, I provided the implementation of the idea and, additionally, I presented the network  architecture used for the simulation, the description of simulated scenarios and the architecture of the implementation. As result, and I have successfully used the simulation tool to generate necessary data for research and presented the example of dataset produced by the simulator.

As future work, I plane to try the simulator with the large amount of users, with the network of enterprise or campus level and random user behavior.
