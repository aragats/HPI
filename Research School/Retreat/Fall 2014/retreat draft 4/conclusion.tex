\section{Conclusion}

We have presented our method of solving the problem of automation of the testbed creation. In case of the lack of data, we proposed the method of simulation of user behavior. To prove the concept of the method we provided the implementation of the idea and we successfully have used the simulation tool to generate necessary data for research. In case of the absent of test network environments for IT security research, we presented the SLG project that allows to automate the process of creation test networks regarding security issues. In addition, we introduced challenges for migration automation of the testbed creation on the cloud.
