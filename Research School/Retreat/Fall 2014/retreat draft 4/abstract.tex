\begin{abstract}


The report summarizes my work in the past semester in the IT security team of the chair "Internet Technologies and Systems". 
%The report contains my views about research work and reflects certain activities in research projects.

The testbed is an important part of any research work in the area of network security and security analytics. Common testbeds are data and test network environments. The absence and the need to create new testbed make an overhead of research work and, as a result, this overhead slows down research progress. Therefore, the issue of automation of the testbed creation is a crucial goal to accelerate research progress. In this report I show a method, which I used for solving a problem of the lack of data for the certain research project in the security analytics area.

The goal of the report is to show a method and identify research challenges in solving the problem of testbed automation for network security and security analytics.
