\section{Conclusion}

In this report, I presented my activities for the past semester. The main idea of the report is to take first steps to proving and find challenges, methods and ways of the automation of testbed for research in security analytics and network Security areas. The first step was creating the application for simulation of user behavior to provide a testbed for security analytics research projects. The next step was learning the platform of the automation of creating test network environments. We proposed to move testbeds on the cloud and defined challenges for that. As a result we plan to go further in the direction of automation of testbed by solving research challenges.
