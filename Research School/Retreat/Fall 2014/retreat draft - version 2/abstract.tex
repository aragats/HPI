\begin{abstract}


The report summarizes my activities of the past semester at the Security Group of the chair "Internet Technologies and Systems". The report contains my views about research works and reflects certain activities in research projects.

The testbed is the important part of any research work in security analytics and network security areas. The absence and the need to create new testbed make the overhead of research work. This overhead slows down the research progress. The most usual testbeds are data and test network environments. 
The second section of the report reflects the method of solving the problem of the lack of data for the certain research project in the security analytics area.
The third section of the report reflects the problem of the absence of test network environments and ways of solving the problem. The section includes an overview of the Security Lab Generator project, an overview of OpenStack project and ideas how they can be used for solving the problem.

The goal of the report is to identify research challenges in solving the main research problems in security analitics and network security areas and suggest the ways of solving them.
