\begin{abstract}


The report summarizes my activities of the past semester at the Security Group of the chair "Internet Technologies and Systems". The report contains my views of research works and reflects certain activities on the research projects.
I started the semester with working on the project "Machine Learning for Security Analytics powered by SAP HANA". Under this project I aimed on writing the application for simulation user behaviors. The report reflects an overview of the project, a description of the test network environment which was used for researching, a description of scenarios of the simulation and implementation details.
The next step was learning the research project called Security Lab Generator. The report includes a overview of the project, a description of installation for testing and learned lessons. 
Based on the experience gained from working and learning on the previous projects I share my view about main problems of academic world. The definition Open Research Cloud is introduced, showed some related works with the Open Research Cloud concept. Some part of the report is devoted to learn open source Infrastructure as a Service called OpenStack and deploy some OpenStack service on the test HPI server. 
In the end I summarize the report by making proposals about researches on the cloud and first steps towards making research on the cloud.
