I introduce the definition Open Research Cloud, show some related works with concept of Open Research Cloud. I was learning open source Infrastructure as a Service called OpenStack, deployed some OpenStack service on the test HPI server. In the report I suggest to use OpenStack a basement for Open Research Cloud. Further I introduce Security Lab Generator and suggest to make the first step towards making research on the cloud by migrating implementation on OpenStack environment. Also I introduce other research project called "Simulation of user behaviors". It include description of the network environment, scenarios of simulation and implementation.
