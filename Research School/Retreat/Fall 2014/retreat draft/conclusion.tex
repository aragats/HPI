\section{Conclusion and Research Question}

The report covered two activities of the past semester. We created the application of simulation user actions. The project needs to be improved. Firstly, we plan to move away from checking the VM state by screenshots, because it makes the program not stable in some cases. Secondly, we plan to implement more complex scenarios of user actions. 

Regarding SLG project we plan to migrate the project int other OpenStack. It makes the project able to use for teaching and CTF seminars. It could be the first step towards Open Research Cloud. During implementation SLG based on OpenStack we try to ask on some research questions: 
\begin{compactitem}
\item How to decompose the project to make use research tools?
\item How to specify the API for collaboration work?
\item How to share research results with other project based on OpenStack?
\item How to normalize research data to make them searchable, indexable and reusable?  
\end{compactitem}
