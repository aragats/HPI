Many research projects come from the industrial companies. It is seems that if the company is interested in success result of the research, the should provide all needed information, data, their environment. But they do not it. And obviously, the reason has a secure aspect. Most of researchers have to spend a big part of their time for preparing or generate data, deploy research environments and so on. The lack of the data is a big problem academic world. The preparation stage has quite big overhead of the research work, which could be overcome in some cases. It is not a secret that many researchers do the almost same researches which require the same data, the same environment. And every time they have to invent new bicycle. 

In this report we mostly speak about the problems of the security researches. We mention certain problems which we impact during the security research and the way of solving the problems. The report include the overview the prototype application which the main goal is to simplify the preparation stage of the research and make possible to overcome the research overhead. Despite the fact that the report contains information about security research all of that could be used for solving problems in the research project of other areas.
