\section{Introduction}

One of the most important factor of the progress in Computer Science is open source projects. There is following idea that if you write something interesting then please share with community. Also open source projects include idea that everyone can contribute thereby forces the progress. Open source is mostly open then free. Free is just a consequence of openness. 

The science world has some problems that slow down the research progress. Most of them are obviously. One of them is a lack of data. Researchers need data to research. The huge amount of data belong to industrial companies, but they do not hurry to share them because of security, privacy reasons. Researches have to generate, simulate data. Next, many researchers need configured network environment to perform research. It means that they have to run Virtual Machines (VMs), install applications, configure a network. Other problem is that during research process researchers usually create a lot of additional tool to help them. But the same tools could be created by other researchers. The tools could be open source or not. Even if they open source it does not mean that you can use in your particular case.  
 
To perform researches is very important to have the necessary data, resources, the opportunity to work with colleagues from other areas. Academic world understands the importance of the collaboration work. As a result, many countries and universities are taking steps to make research more open and move researches on a common environment. Thereby increasing of a productivity of scientists and accelerating a progress. There are several examples of creating some kind of Open Research clouds [4.1].
