Research in the field of Information Security is always faced with the problem of lack of data or a suitable environment. This problem is not limited to research in the field of information security, but also for other areas. For research in the field of information security - is a big problem. Researchers have to find solutions for generate data, constructing a suitable environment, etc. A lot of affords to start the research. In the report, we consider examples of how we in the security group of the chair "Internet Technologies and Systems" solve similar problems. We consider the typical ways of solving them and consider a prototype project that we could help to simplify the implementation of research.
